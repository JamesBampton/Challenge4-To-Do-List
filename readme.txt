Added 3 to do lists, Home, Work and Social.

Configured the Add buttom to work with a Modal, that allows for an item to be added into teh Modal and saved to the main page.

I origonally created an array of items but since the data was not persistant and could not be stored  I decided to clear out the array and leave blank

teh edit buttom used a prompt that works similar to the Modal box. I could use the modal box for edit but the prompt works fine. I could change the modal to 
use prompt but I have left this to demostrate that this can be done both ways. I only found out abous using prompt after creating the Modal.

The desing is really basic, nothing fancy. I owuld like to have formatted this page much bettter than it is but I have run of of time.
I woudl probably look to add an image to each card and some formatting to the buttons as well as adding a footer.
